Creating a SVI and annotation dataset based on the H1 data points/ Number of counties 

Also processs th data just using H1nad H0 data points combined

# In this study labeling the counties and slecting the counties has done in a specific way. Defined method by us!

1. Get the SVI data and get the count of census tract per county and remove the counties that have less than 4 counties (No H1 points) - This can be added to below table
2. From the counties just compute H1 and H0 information. Then add overdose labels
3. Take all the 1(high) counties(but look at the label distribution)
4. Sort the low(0) counties based on the H1 data points and select the cutoff.
5. train using the cutoff data!
